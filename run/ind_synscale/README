This directory holds files that pertain to a SimHE simulation that
allows varying specific parameters: 
- all 8 synaptic weights and 
- all conductances of the HE8 and 12 motor neurons separately.

To start the simulation, run simhe_*.g with the Leech Genesis (lgenesis). See:
http://www.biology.emory.edu/research/Calabrese/software.html

After checking out this directory, move it on a new branch for
creating a new parameter search. Then, explain here the specific
parameters explored.

Parameter sets:

input5_22B_top_model_pair.par:

Just the top model with input 5/22B from previous search
(run_synscale).

input5_22B_top_model_ind_synscale.par:

Combination of 80 variations from top model by varying one HN weight
at a time while keeping others at canonical value; and another 80
variations of independent HN weights where other weights are set to
zero.

input5_22B_top_model_limit.par:

Testing the theoretical limit of input pattern by scaling HN3/7
weights for HE8/12, resp.
